\title{hhss: Hunter Harvest Survey Simulations, and Estimates of Harvest.}
\description{
There are three types of functions within this package:
\code{\link{pop}},
\code{\link{survey}},
\code{\link{est}} \cr\cr
}
\details{
The general flow is designed to go:\cr
\enumerate{
    \item Make a population with \code{pop()}\cr
    \item Take that population and put it through the desired simulations
        using the \code{survey} functions\cr
    \item Estimate total harvest from those simulations using \code{est()}
 }
}

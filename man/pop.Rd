\title{Population and Harvest Simulations}
\usage{
pop(N, split = 1, success1, success0 = success1)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{The desired population size.}

\item{split}{Proportion of the population that is placed into group 1.
The remaining proportion (i.e. \code{1 - split}) will be in group 0.}

\item{success1}{Probability of a hunter in group 1 to harvest}

\item{success0}{Probability of a hunter in group 0 to harvest}
}
\value{
A data frame of class \code{hhss_pop} that contains the variables:
\itemize{
\item \code{pop_size}: The population size.
\item \code{true_harvest}: The sum of harvests from the population.
\item \code{group}: The group in which the hunter was placed.
\item \code{harvest}: 1 for a successful hunter, and 0 if unsuccessful.
}
}
\description{
The pop function simulates a population of hunters and whether or not
they were successful in harvesting.
}
\examples{
# Simulate a population of 10,000 hunters where each hunter has a
# probability of 0.3 to harvest:
pop(N = 10000, success1 = 0.3)

# Simulate a population of 10,000 hunters where roughly 70\% of hunters are in
# group 1, and the remaining 30\% are in group 0. Simulate harvest so hunters
# in group 1 harvest at a probability of 0.3, and hunters in group 0 at 0.5:
pop(N = 10000, split = 0.7, success1 = 0.3, success0 = 0.5)
}

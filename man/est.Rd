\usage{
est(simdat)
}
\arguments{
\item{simdat}{Simulation data. An output from either \code{simple()},
\code{mand()}, or \code{vol()}.}
}
\value{
A tibble, containing the following variables:
\itemize{
\item \code{pop_size}: Hunter population size.
\item \code{resp_bias}: Bias of successful hunters to report,
relative to unsuccessful hunters.
\item \code{resp_rate}: Underlying response probabilities of hunters, if
there was no bias.
\item \code{true_hvst}: True harvest of population.
\item \code{min_hvst_est}: Minimum harvest estimate of the survey
repetitions at the response bias and response rate shown for that row.
\item \code{max_hvst_est}: Maximum harvest estimate.
\item \code{mean_hvst_est}: Average harvest estimate.
\item \code{mean_SE}: Average standard error across repetitions.
\item \code{MARE}: Mean absolute relative error.
\item \code{RRMSE}: Relative root mean squared error.

\description{
Estimates total harvest from a list created by one of
the \code{\link{survey}} functions.
}
\details{
This function relies on the structure of \code{simdat} being unchanged from
its original structure to know how to create estimates.
If you must manipulate the data set, create estimates
from it first, then manipulate it.\cr\cr

All estimations use \code{survey::svydesign()} and
\code{survey::svytotal()} to estimate total harvest. Estimates are
calculated a bit different when a follow up survey is simulated in the
data. In that case, two separate estimates are made using
\code{survey::svytotal()}. One estimate from the respondents to
the initial survey and the other from respondents
to follow up surveys.\cr\cr

In the case of estimates from \code{simple()} outputs,
the proportion of (hunters initially responding / hunters sampled) is
used to scale the initial estimate (i.e. the prop. of respondents is
assumed to make up the same
prop. of the entire population). Then, the follow up respondents are assumed
to be representative of the remaining proportion of the entire population.
This proportion is used to scale the follow up estimate.
Both scaled estimates are then added together to create the combined
estimate.\cr

This is similar to estimates made from \code{vol()} outputs,
except in that case, the proportion of initial respondents \emph{is} the
proportion of the population that responded.\cr

Estimates for \code{mand()} outputs assume 100\% reporting by successful
hunters for initial reports if there is no follow up. If a follow up survey
was simulated, it creates a harvest estimate from the follow up sample to
estimate total harvest for the non-reporting portion of the population, and
then adds that to the sum of initially reported harvests.\cr\cr

\examples{
# First, make a population:
my_pop <- pop(N = 10000, split = 0.7, success1 = 0.25, success0 = 0.32)

# Then simulate a survey for that population:
my_pop_simple_followup <- simple(
  x = my_pop,
  sample = 0.5,
  resp = c(0.4, 0.6),
  bias = seq(1, 1.3, 0.1),
  fus = TRUE,
  fus_scale = 0.7,
  times = 10
)

# Finally, make your estimates:
est(my_pop_simple_followup)
